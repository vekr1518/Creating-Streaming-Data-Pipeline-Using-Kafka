# Creating-Streaming-Data-Pipeline-Using-Kafka

## Introduction
In this project, we are going to de-congest the traffic data by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll gates. As a vehicle passes a toll, 
the vehicleâ€™s data like **vehicle_id**, **vehicle_type**, **toll_plaza_id** and **timestamp** are streamed to Kafka. 

Our job is to create a end-to-end data pipe line that collects the streaming data using **kafka** and load it into a s3.
